# Excel2Grafana
A simple tool to get data from excel and upload to grafana thru API

Current feature: Convert Excel to Xml.

It's not so smart at the moment, only support excel file as a static format. You can modify it as you want.
The format of excel file can find in the resources section of the solution.

Cheers.
